# GateWarPagarMeTest
A simple test for integration with the "pagarMe" sandbox of tests

Using https://docs.pagar.me/reference/pix-2,Â I setup a simple test for the payment process. Pix is a new way to make payments or transfers between banks in Brazil. You can check it out at https://www.bcb.gov.br/estabilidadefinanceira/pix

PagarMe offers other types of payments like credit cards, etc.

You can install PagarMe on Nuget from Visual Studio and read more about it in the PagarMe documentation: https://docs.pagar.me/docs/.
